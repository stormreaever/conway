> Conway's Game of Life on an Adafruit Trellis M4

Read the [Wikipedia page on Conway's Game of Life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life) for some background on what this project is. 

I'm simulating this game on the Trellis' 4x8 LED grid. Each LED is also a button that toggles the LED's state. And I'm adding some unrelated color. 

## Hardware

Adafruit NeoTrellis M4 Express

## Setup

Install the Arduino IDE, the board & libraries using this guide: 

[https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-neotrellis-m4](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-neotrellis-m4)

Plug the thing in, select the board & port, then run the sketch.
